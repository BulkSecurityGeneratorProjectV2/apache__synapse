                The file transport, also known as the VFS (Virtual File System) transport, can be
                used to read, mediate and write file content using Synapse. This transport allows
                Synapse to interface with the local file system and remote file systems via
                file transfer protocols such as FTP.
            </p>
            <p>
                The file transport is based on <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/">Apache Commons VFS</a>,
                and supports all the file transfer protocols supported by Commons VFS. This includes
                interactions with the local file system, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SFTP (i.e. file transfer
                over SSH).
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a fundamental difference between the file transport and transports such as
                HTTP, and it is important to understand this difference to be able to use the file
                transport correctly. The HTTP transport binds to a single protocol endpoint, i.e. a
                TCP port on which it accepts incoming HTTP requests. These requests are then
                dispatched to the appropriate service based on the request URI. On the other hand,
                the file transport only receives the payload of a message (i.e. the file), but no
                additional information that could be used to dispatch the message to a service. This
                means that file system locations must be explicitly mapped to services. This is done
                using a set of service parameters. For Synapse this means that the VFS transport
                listener can only be used in conjunction with proxy services. The relevant service
                parameters are specified in the proxy service configuration as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="xmlConf">&lt;proxy name=&quot;MyVFSService&quot; transports=&quot;vfs&quot;&gt;
    &lt;parameter name=&quot;transport.vfs.FileURI&quot;&gt;file:///var/spool/synapse/in&lt;/parameter&gt;
    &lt;parameter name=&quot;transport.vfs.ContentType&quot;&gt;application/xml&lt;/parameter&gt;
    ...
    &lt;target&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/proxy&gt;</div>
            <p>
                In the above example the file system location file:///var/spool/synapse/in is
                explicitly bound to MyVFSService. Any file dropped in that location will be
                pre-dispatched to MyVFSService, bypassing any other configured dispatch mechanisms
                that would normally apply to messages received via HTTP.

                The file transport consists of a transport listener component and a transport sender
                component. Proxy services can read files using the file transport listener, and they
                can write file content using the file transport sender. Following sections describe
                how to configure these two components of the transport.
            </p>
            <subsection name="File Transport Listener (VFS Listener)" id="Listener">
                <p>
                    Before a proxy service can read files, the VFS listener must be enabled in the
                    <string>SYNAPSE_HOME/repository/conf/axis2.xml</string> file of Synapse. Look
                    for the following XML configuration in the axis2.xml file, and uncomment it if
                    it's commented out.
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;transportReceiver name="vfs" class="org.apache.synapse.transport.vfs.VFSTransportListener"/&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    To configure a proxy service to receive messages via the VFS listener (i.e. read
                    files from some local or remote location), set the "transports" attribute on the
                    proxy service element to "vfs":
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;proxy name=&quot;MyVFSService&quot; transports=&quot;vfs&quot;&gt;
    ...
&lt;/proxy&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    It's also possible to expose a proxy service on VFS transport and several other
                    transports. Simply specify the required transports as a space-separated list in
                    the "transports" attribute:
                </p>
                <div class="xmlConf">&lt;proxy name=&quot;MyVFSService&quot; transports=&quot;vfs http https&quot;&gt;
    ...
&lt;/proxy&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    A proxy service configured with the VFS listener, can be further customized by
                    setting a number of parameters (some of which are required). Following table
                    lists all the supported service parameters.

                            services are reading files from the same location or when one proxy service
                            is configured to read the files written by another proxy service.

                            important because locking can be disabled at the global level by
                            specifying that at the transport receiver configuration (in axis2.xml) and

                            javax.activation.DataSource (instead of a java.io.InputStream ) object
                            to pass the content of the file to the message builder. Note that this
                            is only supported by some message builders, e.g. for plain text and binary.
                            This allows processing of the message without storing the entire content in memory.
                            It also has two other side effects:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The incoming file (or connection in case of a remote file)
                                    will only be opened on demand.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Since the data is not cached, the file might be read several
                                    times.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            This option can be used to achieve streaming of large payloads. Note
                            that this feature is still somewhat experimental and might be superseded
                            by a more flexible mechanism in a future release.
