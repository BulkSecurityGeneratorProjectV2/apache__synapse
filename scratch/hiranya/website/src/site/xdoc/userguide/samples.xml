        <section name="Apache Synapse Samples Catalog">
            <p>
                Apache Synapse comes prelaoded with a horde of sample configurations that
                demonstrates various features of the service bus. This catalog lists out all
                these sample configurations and provides detailed information on how to run
                them. These samples require an Apache ANT installation for you to be able to
                try them out. If you are new to Synapse and have no experience running Synapse,
                the Quick Start Guide may be a better starting point. If you are comfortable
                with running Synapse samples, please go ahead and pick the samples you are
                interested in.
