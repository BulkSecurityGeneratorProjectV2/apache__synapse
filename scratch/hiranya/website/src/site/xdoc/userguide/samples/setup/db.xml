            <p>
                Apache Synapse has the ability to lookup and update relational databases through
                JDBC. Any database engine that provides JDBC drivers can be integrated with
                Synapse using the dblookup and dbreport mediators. Synapse ships with a collection
                of samples which demonstrates various aspects of dblookup, dbreport mediators and
                database integration. This article describes how to setup the databases and
                sample tables required to try these examples out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most samples assume Apache Derby is used as the database engine. And therefore this
                article also focuses mainly on setting up Apache Derby. Byt in reality
                any database engine can be used to run these samples. The database schema and SQL
                queries described here will work with any database engine. However in such cases
                some minor changes should be made to the Synapse configuration files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some samples involve invoking database stored procedures from Synapse. For these
                samples MySQL database engine is assumed. Therefore this article provides some
                basic information on setting up MySQL for the example scenarios.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Setting Up Apache Derby" id="derby">
            <p>
                To start with, download the latest binary distribution of <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache Derby</a>.
                Extract the downloaded archive to a suitable location in the local disk and switch
                to the 'bin' directory of the installation. Start the Derby network server by
                executing the 'startNetworkServer' startup script. An output similar to the following
                will be displayed as the database engine starts up.
            </p>
            <div class="consoleOutput">Sun Jan 02 10:53:28 IST 2011 : Security manager installed using the Basic server security policy.
Sun Jan 02 10:53:30 IST 2011 : Apache Derby Network Server - 10.7.1.1 - (1040133) started and ready to accept connections on port 1527</div>
            <p>
                Now launch the Derby client tool by executing the 'ij' script. This will give a command
                prompt where you can execute various command and SQL queries. Execute the following
                connect statement to create a fresh database named 'synapsedb' and obtain a connection
                to it.
            </p>
            <div class="command">CONNECT 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/synapsedb;user=synapse;password=synapse;create=true';</div>
            <p>
                Now execute the following SQL query to create a new table.
            </p>
            <div class="command">CREATE table company(name varchar(10), id varchar(10), price double);</div>
            <p>
                Insert some sample data to the table by executing following statements.
            </p>
            <div class="command">INSERT into company values ('IBM','c1',0.0);
INSERT into company values ('SUN','c2',0.0);
INSERT into company values ('MSFT','c3',0.0);</div>
            <p>
                Now we have finished setting up the Derby server for the samples. As the final step
                we should copy the Derby JDBC drivers to Synapse 'lib' directory. Locate the following
                jar files in Derby installation and copy them into Synapse.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>derby.jar</li>
                <li>derbyclient.jar</li>
                <li>derbynet.jar</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section name="Setting Up MySQL" id="mysql">
            <p>
                This section assumes that you already have a MySQL server instance up and running.
                For details on installing MySQL, please refer the relevant
                <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/installing.html">MySQL documentation</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a new database named 'synapsedb' in MySQL. Then execute the SQL queries
                given in the previous section to create a table named 'company' and insert some
                sample data into it. Then execute the following two commands in MySQL client to
                create two stored procedures.
            </p>
            <div class="command">CREATE PROCEDURE getCompany(compName VARCHAR(10)) SELECT name, id, price FROM company WHERE name = compName;
        CREATE PROCEDURE updateCompany(compPrice DOUBLE,compName VARCHAR(10)) UPDATE company SET price = compPrice WHERE name = compName;</div>
            <p>
                Then you should download the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/">MySQL JDBC driver</a>
                and deploy it into the 'lib' directory of Synapse.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Using Other Database Engines" id="other">
            <p>
                You can run the given samples using any RDBMS engine you prefer. In that case please
                make sure you do the following.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deploy the JDBC drivers for your database engine into Synapse</li>
                <li>
                    Update the sample configuration files and change the driver class name and JDBC
                    connection string correctly
                </li>
            </ul>
