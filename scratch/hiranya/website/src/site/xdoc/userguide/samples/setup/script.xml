		<section name="Configuring Synapse for Script Mediator Support"
			id="intro">
			<p>
				The Synapse Script Mediator is a Synapse extension, and thus all
				prerequisites are not bundled by default with the Synapse
				distribution.Before you use some script mediators you may need to
				manually add the required jar files to the Synapse lib directory, and
				optionally 	perform other installation tasks as may be required by the
				individual scripting language. This is explained in the following
				sections.
			</p>
			<subsection name="JavaScript Support" id="javaScript">

				<p>
					The JavaScript/E4X support is enabled by default and comes
					ready-to-use with the Synapse distribution.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Ruby Support" id="ruby">
				<p>
					For Ruby support you need to download the 'jruby-complete.jar'
					from the Maven repository for JRuby, and copy it into the 'lib'
					folder of Synapse . The JRuby JAR can be downloaded from
					<a class="externalLink"
						href="http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/jruby/jruby-complete/1.3.0/jruby-complete-1.3.0.jar">
						here
					</a>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="JSON Support" id="json">
				<p>
					<a class="externalLink" href="http://json.org">JSON</a>
					is a lightweight data-interchange format.
					It can be used as an alternative to XML or SOAP. To enable the JSON
					support in Synapse, following two jar files should be deployed into the 'lib'
					directory of Synapse.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a class="externalLink" href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/axis2/axis2-json">axis2-json.jar</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a class="externalLink" href="http://jettison.codehaus.org/Download">jettison.jar</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
      			Having deployed the necessary libraries you should now register the JSON message
      			builder and formatter with Synapse. Open up 'repository/conf/axis2.xml' file
      			of Synapse and add the following two entries under the 'messageBuilders' and
      			'messageFormatters' sections respectively.
    			</p>
    			<div class="xmlConf">&lt;messageBuilder contentType=&quot;application/json&quot;
    class=&quot;org.apache.axis2.json.JSONOMBuilder&quot;/&gt;

&lt;messageFormatter contentType=&quot;application/json&quot;
    class=&quot;org.apache.axis2.json.JSONMessageFormatter&quot;/&gt;</div>
    			<p>
                    If you are planning to run sample 440, you should also add the above two entries
                    to the 'samples/axis2Client/client_repo/conf/axis2.xml' file.
    			</p>
