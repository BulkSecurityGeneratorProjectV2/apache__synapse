 * A piped output stream can be connected to a piped input stream
 * to create a communications pipe. The piped output stream is the
 * sending end of the pipe. Typically, data is written to a
 * <code>PipedOutputStream</code> object by one thread and data is
 * read from the connected <code>PipedInputStream</code> by some
 * other thread. Attempting to use both objects from a single thread
 * is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
