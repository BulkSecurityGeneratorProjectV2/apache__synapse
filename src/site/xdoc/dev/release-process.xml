        <section name="Release Process">
            <p>
                We follow the standard <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing.html">ASF release process</a>.
                One of the committers would volunteer to play the release manager role for a given
                release. A few days will be spent on stabilizing the Synapse development trunk,
                improving its documentation and test coverage. When the code base is in a satisfactory
                state a release branch would be created under
                <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/synapse/branches">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/synapse/branches</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                From this point onwards all committers will switch to the newly created development
                branch. It is highly recommended to ensure that all the changes done on the development
                branch are also checked into the main development branch. Open JIRA issues will be
                reviewed and rearranged accordingly. Many of the issues will get resolved during this
                process and the remaining few will be accordingly prioritized and scheduled for a
                future release. The unit tests and integration tests will be used extensively during
                this critical period to keep the development branch in its most stable form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally the release manager would trigger the release build, sign the generated artifacts
                and host them on people.apache.org for review. A release vote will be called urging
                all those interested to review the packs and provide feedback. Upon receiving the
                necessary number of votes, a release tag will be created and the release artifacts will
                be uploaded to the appropriate servers for distribution.
