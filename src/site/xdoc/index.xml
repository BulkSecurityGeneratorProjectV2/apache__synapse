            <p>
                Apache Synapse is a lightweight and high-performance Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).
                Powered by a fast and asynchronous mediation engine, Apache Synapse provides
                exceptional support for XML, Web Services and REST. In addition to XML and SOAP,
                Apache Synapse supports several other content interchange formats, such as plain
                text, binary, Hessian and JSON. The wide range of transport adapters available for
                Synapse, enables it to communicate over many application and transport layer
                protocols. As of now, Apache Synapse supports HTTP/S, Mail (POP3, IMAP, SMTP),
                JMS, TCP, UDP, VFS, SMS, XMPP and FIX.
            </p>
